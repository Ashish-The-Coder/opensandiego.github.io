## Overview

The [Linda Vista Library](https://www.sandiego.gov/public-library/locations/linda-vista-library) is looking into facilitating peer-to-peer lending within their community for foreign language and hard to get books for their diverse international community. Open San Diego is working to build a tool to allow the staff of the library branch to manage and assist in this lending program.
