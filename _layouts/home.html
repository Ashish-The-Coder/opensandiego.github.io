      <h1 class="jumbotron-heading">we are OPEN SAN DIEGO</h1>
      <p class="lead">We are San Diegans who believe a healthier interface between government and technology leads to a healthier democracy and more vibrant civic life. We care about our communities, our fellow citizens, and our civic institutions, and work together to support and bolster our Public. We are a chapter of the national, non-partisan Code for America, leveraging their resources, but focused on our own local issues. We welcome our fellow San Diegans of every skill level and background to be a part of this movement!</p>
