          <h2>Mayor Elect Faulconer:</h2>
          <p>We are writing as concerned citizens and experienced IT professionals in opposition to Administrative Regulation 90.67 (AR 90.67). As you undoubtedly know, AR 90.67 was implemented by Interim Mayor Todd Gloria on February 27 and specified that &ldquo;e-mails that are older than one year will be automatically deleted from the City&rsquo;s E-mail Systems.&rdquo;</p>
          <p>The implementation memorandum specified that the reason for this deletion was due IT challenges, with the &ldquo;City E-mail Systems being overburdened.&rdquo; Gloria&rsquo;s office separately stated that the cost of retaining emails would be $400,000 - $500,000<sup><a href="#footnotes">1</a></sup>.</p>
          <p>This suggested cost is significantly out of line with our experiences. Based on our calculations, you could implement a cloud solution that maintains a 10 year archive of emails for 11,000 city employees<sup><a href="#footnotes">2</a></sup> for an annual cost of $96,000<sup><a href="#footnotes">3</a></sup>.  Maintaining local storage would likely cost even less.</p>
          <p>The suggestion that storing email is burdensome is a holdover from an era when records were stored in filing cabinets. Keeping an accessible archive of emails is relatively inexpensive. Moreover, it&rsquo;s essential for city employees to perform their jobs as well as making it possible for San Diegans to understand how their government is working for them.</p>
          <p><strong>We strongly encourage you to revoke AR 90.67 as your first act as Mayor.</strong></p>
          <p>Thank you for your prompt attention.</p>
          <p>Sincerely,</p>
